# vgrep

**vgrep** is a Python script to search strings in a given source tree.  It is
inspired by **cgvg**, but faster by using *git grep*.

Feedback & patches are always welcome.  Feel free to copy, change, distribute
and share.

##Usage Example:

###Searching a symbol

- **vgrep FOO** to search *FOO* in your current directory.  You can also specify
  multiple arguments that you may search for.

- The output has the format "**Index** **File** **Line** **Content**", whereas
  the index can later be used to open the specific location in an editor.  Hits
  are highlighted in the content lines.

- Run vgrep without arguments to see the results of the last query.

An example call could look as follows:

####vgrep-specific options:

- **'--no-git'** to use to *grep* instead (required outside a Git repository).

- **'--no-git-submodules'** to not recurse into Git submodules. Git submodule
  search is only useful within a Git Repository (see --no-git).

- **'--no-header'** to compress the whitespace a bit to help fit more
  information on each line.  This option is helpful if you are working on a
  terminal with few columns, or have long filenames or paths to search.

####grep-specific options:

- Note that all non-vgrep specific options/arguments will be passed to *git
  grep* or *grep*.  To give a few examples:

- **vgrep -w FOO** will match *FOO* only at word boundaries.  Since vgrep has
no option *-w* it will be passed to (git) grep respectively.

- **vgrep FOO -- "*.c"** to grep only in .c files.

- Please refer to their manuals for further information.

###Show indexed location

To visit a specific location pass **'--show INDEX'**.  vgrep will then open the
location pointed to by *INDEX* with the editor that is set in your *enviroment*.
vgrep defaults to *vim* if the *EDITOR* environment variable is not set.

``` bash
[~/linux/kernel/irq]$ export EDITOR=gedit
[~/linux/kernel/irq]$ vgrep --show 4
```

####Show Expressions

Once vgreped, you can perform certain operations on the results, such as
limiting the range of displayed hits, listing files, etc.

```
help: <Selector><Cmd>
      Selector:  `3' (one) `5,23' (mult.) `7-10' (range) `/ker.el/' (regex)
      Cmd:  print, show, context, tree, delete, files, execute, quit,
      E.g.: 40,45s -- show matches 40 and 45 in $EDITOR
```

Thanks to [stettberger](https://github.com/stettberger) for adding this
functionality to vgrep.
